# Service Contract Agreement

This Service Contract Agreement is between the **Contractor**, Kenneth Rogers II, and the **Client**, `second party`. The parties agree:

# Work

_Contractor_ will do the work and services described in each **Statement of Work** cosigned with _Client_ under this agreement. _Client_ will pay the fees described in each _Statement of Work_, and reimburse expenses that _Client_ approves in writing, specifically, in advance. _Contractor_ will bill _Client_ for fees and expenses as described in each  _Statement of Work_.

# Payment

## Deadline

_Client_ will pay each correctly billed amount within `payment deadline` of receiving the invoice.

## Late Payments

_Client_ will pay _Contractor_ `late payment interest` interest on late bill payments, compounded monthly. If the law sets a lower maximum rate of late-payment interest, _Client_ will pay that rate instead.

## Errors

_Client_ will notify _Contractor_ by e-mail of any suspected error in a bill within `billing error notice deadline` of receiving the bill. If _Client_ does not notify of an error in that time, _Client_ will pay the billed amount.

## Stopping Work

If _Client_ does not pay a bill on time, _Contractor_ may notify _Client_ by e-mail and stop work until all bills are paid. Stopping work in this way postpones all deadlines under this agreement for as long as work stops. Any recurring fees continue to add up.

## Cost of Collection

If _Client_ does not pay a bill on time, _Client_ agrees to pay _Contractor_'s costs of pursuing payment and collecting that bill, such as attorney fees and costs, that _Contractor_ incurs after the deadline for payment.

# Term

## Expiration

This agreement will end once `expiration timeout` have passed since there was any ongoing _Statement of Work_.

## Early Termination

Both _Client_ and _Contractor_ can terminate this agreement early by notifying the other by e-mail `nonrenewal deadline` in advance.

## Final Bill

When this agreement ends, _Contractor_ will stop work and bill _Client_ for work already done.

## Continuing Provisions

These sections continue to apply after this agreement ends: [Work](#work), [Payment](#payment), [Working Relationship](#working-relationship), and [Limit on Liability](#limit-on-liability).

# Working Relationship

## Independence

_Contractor_ will decide when, where, and how to work under this agreement, with the discretion of an independent contractor. _Contractor_ will not have any power to enter agreements or take other legal action on _Client_'s behalf.

## Personnel

Unless a _Statement of Work_ says otherwise, _Contractor_ may use employee and contractor personnel to do any work under this agreement. Those personnel will be employees and contractors of _Contractor_, not _Client_.

## No Benefits

Neither _Contractor_ nor any _Contractor_ personnel will receive any employee benefits from _Client_.

## Compliance

Both _Client_ and _Contractor_ will do their respective parts for tax, labor, employment, and immigration law compliance, consistent with their independent-contractor relationship under this agreement.

## Compliance Indemnity

_Contractor_ will pay any losses that _Client_ pays or becomes legally responsible to pay, including expenses of defending against any _Legal Claim_, related to _Contractor_'s failure under [Compliance](#compliance) for _Contractor_ or any _Contractor_ personnel. _Client_ will promptly notify _Contractor_ by e-mail whenever it anticipates possible losses that _Contractor_ might have to pay. If _Client_ fails to notify _Contractor_ promptly, _Contractor_ will not pay _Client_ losses that _Contractor_ could have reduced or defended against if _Client_ had notified _Contractor_ promptly.

# Intellectual Property

  - copyrights, mask work rights, and moral rights

  - patent rights

  - trade names, trademarks, service marks, and trade dress

  - database rights

  - rights in registrations and applications for _Intellectual Property Rights_

- **Infringement** means infringement of _Intellectual Property Rights_, before or after the date of this agreement.

- **Legal Claim** means any legal action or claim, ignoring the historical distinction between actions "in law" and "in equity".

- **New Intellectual Property** means all of these, created by _Contractor_ alone or with others:

  - all _Intellectual Property Rights_ that _Contractor_ created before entering into this agreement, as a head start on work under a _Statement of Work_

  - all _Intellectual Property Rights_ that _Contractor_ creates as a result of _Contractor_'s work under any _Statement of Work_

  - all _Intellectual Property Rights_ created by _Contractor_ using _Client_ equipment, supplies, facilities, or trade secrets

## Contractor Assigns IP

- ownership of _New Intellectual Property_

- all other rights _Contractor_ has in _New Intellectual Property_

# Limit on Liability

!!! As far as the law allows, if _Client_ makes any _Legal Claim_ against _Contractor_ related to this agreement, _Contractor_'s aggregate liability to _Client_ will be capped at the amount of fees _Client_ has actually paid _Contractor_ under this agreement.
